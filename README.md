# The R-oot of All Evil: Premature Optimization

I gave a talk at the weekly Davis R Users Group meeting on 2/12/18. The RMarkdown and html files for the slide presentation can be found here!

I also plan on creating a non-slides RMarkdown writeup just to make things a little easier to read through post-talk.
